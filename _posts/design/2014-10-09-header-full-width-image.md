It's so easy to do. Just define in front matter an image and a background color. Instead of a color you can also use a pattern image. Have a look at the [example with a background pattern]({{Â site.url }}/design/header-pattern/).

## Front Matter Code

~~~
header:
    image:  "header_unsplash_2-970x.jpg"
    background-color:  "#fabb00"
~~~



## All Header-Styles 

{% include list-posts.html tag='header' %}
