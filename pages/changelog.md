2015-01-12 // Version 0.94
:   Added Windows 8-Tile in `config.yml` and `header.html`. Added `_config_dev.yml` for easier local development. Use `jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml` to overwrite `url`-settings of the main configuration. Added `_data/network.yml` to customize links in the footer-area. Now with 404-page and a google-powered search.

2014-09-16 // Version 0.8
:   Added [video post format][5] for that cinematic flavor. Added URL- and Credit-feature to images and revamped the homepage a little bit to give blog-content more exposure. Optimized some includes, especially the `_include/list-posts.html`-Include which support some nifty parameters.

2014-09-15 // Version 0.7
:   Added an [example of a gallery][4] to show how to use Clearing Lightbox. Meta information is used in posts via `/include/meta_information.html`. To optimize pages/posts for search engines you have now have an extra front matter-variable called `meta_description`. Also the theme supports facebook open graph information.
